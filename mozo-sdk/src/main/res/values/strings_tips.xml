    <string-array name="tips_retailer_answer">
        <item>MozoX Tokens are digital utility tokens that can be used by merchants to reward customers for visiting their venues. Customers can collect MozoX Tokens and redeem them for discounts on products and services as determined by each merchant.</item>
        <item>By offering MozoX Tokens for visiting your venue, customers will have an incentive to come there and by offering discounts through a redemption program you are ensured that customers will want to keep collecting MozoX Tokens.</item>
        <item>With MozoX, you only reward customers when they physically enter your venue, so there is a 1:1 correlation between advertising monies spent and customers in your store. Other advertising channels do not offer any guarantees that their clicks or banners will result in customers in your venue.</item>
        <item>Customer will accumulate enough amount of reward tokens aka MozoX to redeem them with deals, discounts and promotions in the loyalty program. So they are incentivized to go to where retailers and venue operators set up airdrop events. By applying new technology blockchain, MozoX is more secure than any traditional loyalty applications. Furthermore, by incorporated with location based service technology, MozoX ensure that user really enter physically the venue.\nRetailer and venue operator will use MozoX Retailer App to set up airdrop event incorporated with a beacon, a specific location detector, that is required user should be in beacon range can receive MozoX. This will help Retailer and venue operator control the foot traffic. Furthermore, using MozoX Retailer App, Retailer and venue operator can set up the deals, discounts and promotions.\nCustomer will use MozoX App to browse, search, discover the airdrop events, deals, discounts and promotions setting up by Retailer and venu operators.\nMozoX App also help Retailer/venue operators and customer perform the deals, discount and promotion in effectiveness and efficiency way.</item>
        <item>Hashtags are a word or phrase preceded by a hash sign (#). On MozoX, hashtags are used to help identify your venue according to the description you want customers to discover you by.</item>
        <item>One you have finalized and saved an airdrop event, you cannot retrieve the MozoX Tokens set aside for the event. If the airdrop event status is &quot;Scheduled&quot; or &quot;Active&quot; you are obligated to use the MozoX tokens for the duration of the event.  Once the event status is &quot;Ended&quot;, you can retrieve any MozoX Tokens that have not been airdropped to customers.</item>
        <item>We do not recommend sharing Administrator rights with your employees. MozoX Retailer App allows for sub-accounts which grant permissions similar to the Administrator, except that they are not able to edit store information, beacon or sub-accounts. Please note that the sub-account wallet is set to zero when the sub-account is created. The Administrator will need to transfer MozoX Tokens to a sub-account in order for the sub-account holder to create airdrop events..</item>
        <item>If they walk into beacon range of your store in the time the airdrop event happens, they will receive MozoX</item>
